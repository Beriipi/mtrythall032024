- Very popular menu choice.
- Can be used in place of other starchy foods in a meal.

sauces.
- You can buy pasta dried or fresh, but fresh pasta cooks
faster.
- There are more than 100 varieties of pasta available in a number of shapes, sizes, and colors.
- A pasta’s color reflects its flavor.
- One of the main ingredients in pasta is flour. The other main ingredient in pasta is a liquid, such as water or eggs. Oil is sometimes added to pasta dough to give it a richer texture.
- Most commercial dried pastas are made from semolina flour, a hard grain wheat flour that is high in the proteins that form gluten. Semolina flour produces a smooth dough and creamy yellow color.

# Quality Characteristics of Pasta
#### 2 ways to determine the quality of pasta used in foodservice operations:
- Flour – Semolina, a high-protein flour, produces the best dry pasta. Dry pasta should contain 100% semolina flour.
- Freshness – Dry pasta should be hard and brittle. It should snap cleanly instead of bending easily.

#### Dried Pasta:
- Often purchased in bags and boxes.

- Can be purchased fresh or frozen.
- Comes in a variety of flavors: spinach, tomato-garlic, and whole-wheat.
